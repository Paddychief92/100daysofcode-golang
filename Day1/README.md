# Introduction üéÄ

Before I could start with the challenge. Let me talk a few things why I am taking this challenge and Why others should also take... ***Because***

## Short Story üìî

Learning a new language is always good to keep yourself updated with technology. Similarly, I decided to learn Golang because my organization was deciding to move (backend) from #PERL to #GO.

But before we could directly hope on GO(golang),
we started with JAVA, Node, and Erlang(and some RUST) where JAVA didn't scale much as we expected, Nodejs turned out to be that great for frontend but didn't satisfy our use-case, and Erlang/Rust was awesome and scale but time-consuming for developers to Learn...

After a few benchmarks and statistics of Golang, we noticed that **GO** is Simple, Fast, scalable, and library rich language that means easy to adapt and learn, production-ready, and huge geeky community...

I started Learning GOlang and became familiar 8-9 months ago. I started with a project to migrate the existing code from PERL to XYZ programming language(I chose GOlang because one of my colleagues as already used it in production...).
Since the experiment with GOlang has already resulted in scale from 10k events/sec to 1 million events/sec, this was not only impressive but misled of making everything component in GOlang üòÖ. 

The journey began and made me fell in love ‚ù§Ô∏è with this GO language... 

Since the projects didn't give you a complete overview of any programming languages, it is necessary to get brushed up from scratch... and that thinking made me start with the #100daysofcode challenge for GOlang.

I hope the you can relate the challenge now!
